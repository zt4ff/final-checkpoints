// Write a function RevConcatAlternate() that receives two slices of int as arguments and returns a new slice with alternated values of each slice in reverse order.

// The input slices can have different lengths.

// The new slice should start with the elements from the largest slice first and when they became equal size slices,
// it should add an element of the first given slice.

// If the slices are of equal length, the new slice should start
// with an element of the first slice.

// Note: you can check the examples bellow for more details.
